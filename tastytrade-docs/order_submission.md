# Submitting an Order


Generating the proper JSON to submit an order for the first time can seem like a daunting task. For some, the biggest challenge is understanding how to structure a JSON order. For others, the challenge may be learning the meaning of the various JSON order attributes.


This page is intended to clarify all the order attributes for you as well as explain the rules about how to structure a JSON order. This page only describes attributes for *submitting* an order. Other order attributes like **status** are populated after order submission and are not described here.


This pag also assumes you are familiar with what an order means in the tastytrade ecosystem. For a primer, you can head to the [High-level Concepts: Orders](/api-overview#high-level-concepts-orders) section of our API Overview.


## Example Order


To start, take a look at the [example multi-leg equity option order](/order-submission/#example-multi-leg-equity-option-order) below. This order has 2 legs: the first is a 197.5 call that we are buying and the second is a 200 call that we are selling. The strike price is found in the last 8 numeric characters of the symbol, where the first 5 digits are the whole number value (left of the decimal point) and the last 3 digits are the decimal value (right of the decimal point).


Looking at each leg's **symbol**, we can see that both options have an expiration date of `2023-08-18`.


Both legs have "Open" in the **action**, meaning we are opening up new positions.


We have specified a limit price of $1.09 Debit, meaning we won't pay more than $1.09 for this order.


If you submitted this order and it filled, the result would be 2 new positions in your account: a long 2023-08-18 call option with a 197.5 strike and a short 2023-08-18 call option with a 200 strike.


Example Multi-leg Equity Option Order

```json
{ // Order Attributes
"time-in-force": "Day", // Order will expire when the market closes
"order-type": "Limit", // Order includes a limit price
"price": "1.09", // Don't pay more than $1.09 for this trade as a whole
"price-effect": "Debit", // Account will be debited for this trade
"legs": [
{
// Leg Attributes
"action": "Buy to Open", // Opening a new long position
"symbol": "AAPL 230818C00197500", // AAPL Call Option with 197.5 strike price, option expires 2023-08-18
"quantity": 1, // 1 option contract
"instrument-type": "Equity Option", // Equity Option instrument
},
{
// Leg Attributes
"action": "Sell to Open", // Opening a new short position
"symbol": "AAPL 230818C00200000", // AAPL Call Option with 200 strike price, option expires 2023-08-18
"quantity": 1, // 1 option contract
"instrument-type": "Equity", // Equity Option instrument
}
]
}

```


The above order JSON might seem complicated, so let's simplify it a little by breaking the order JSON into 2 parts:


- The Order attributes

- The Leg attributes


## Order Attributes


Order attributes are any attributes that apply to the order as a whole. In short, they are any JSON attributes outside the objects in the **legs** array.


Refer to the table below for the JSON attributes of an order object. Each attribute is explained in further detail in the sections below.


| Order Attribute | Required | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gtc-date | Only if time-in-force is GTD | Date string (yyyy-mm-dd) | The date at which a GTD order expires |
| legs | Yes | Array of leg objects | Refer to the Leg Attributes section below |
| order-type | Yes | String | The type of order being submitted |
| price | Yes unless order-type is Notional Market | Decimal | The limit price of the order |
| price-effect | Yes unless order-type is Notional Market | String | The price's direction in relation to your account (Credit or Debit) |
| source | No | String | Designates where the order originated. Value can be any string you want. |
| stop-trigger | Only if order-type is Stop or Stop Limit | String | The trigger price of a Stop or Stop Market order |
| time-in-force | Yes | String | How long the order will live if not filled or rejected |
| value | Only if order-type is Notional Market | Decimal | The dollar amount of an instrument to buy or sell |
| value-effect | Only if order-type is Notional Market | String | The direction of the value in relation to your account (Credit or Debit) |
| advanced-instructions | No | Json | Detailed instructions about the order |


### Order Type


Order type typically affects how the the price/value of an order is defined.


Refer to the table below for each order type and its meaning. Each order type is described in detail in the sections below as well.


| Order Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Limit | Order must have a price and price-effect included in the JSON. |
| Market | Order must not have price or price-effect included in the JSON. |
| Stop | A market order with a stop-trigger price in the JSON. |
| Stop Limit | A limit order with a stop-trigger price in the JSON. |
| Notional Market | An order to buy a dollar amount of something rather than a specific quantity |


**Limit**


Limit orders must have a price and price-effect, which is the min/max price you're willing to accept.


Here are the rules for the JSON structure of a Limit order:


- Must include a **price** and **price-effect**


Here's an example: If you are buying shares of stock and submit a limit order with a price of $5, you're effectively saying "I won't pay more than $5 per share for 100 shares of AAPL." In a dream world some nice person would sell you those shares for $5 per share. In the real world your order would go live and probably remain live until it expires or you cancel it.


Limit Order Example

```js
{
"time-in-force": "Day",
"order-type": "Limit",
"price": 5,
"price-effect": "Debit"
"legs": [
{
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"symbol": "AAPL",
"quantity": 100,
"action": "Buy to Open"
}
]
}

```


**Market**


Market orders don't have a price at all. By submitting a market order, you are basically saying "I want this order filled as quick as possible and I'll accept any price."


Here are the rules for the JSON structure of a Market order:


- Orders must only have 1 leg

- Must **not** include a **price** or **price-effect**

- **time-in-force** must **not** be `GTC`


Opening market orders cannot be submitted while the market is closed.


Please see our [help center article on market orders](https://support.tastyworks.com/support/solutions/articles/43000504228-what-is-a-market-order-) for the pros and cons of market orders.


Market Order Example

```js
{
"time-in-force": "Day",
"order-type": "Market",
"legs": [
{
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"symbol": "AAPL",
"quantity": 100,
"action": "Buy to Open"
}
]
}

```


**Stop**


Stop orders are market orders that are triggered when the quote hits a specific price, called a **stop-trigger**. When the quote hits the stop-trigger, the order becomes a market order.


Here are the rules for the JSON structure of a Stop order:


- Must **not** include a **price** or **price-effect**

- Must include a **stop-trigger** price

- **time-in-force** must **not** be `GTC` for opening orders


"Stop" and "Stop Market" are the same concept, but only a value of `Stop` is allowed in the JSON.


Please refer to our [help center article on stop orders](https://support.tastyworks.com/support/solutions/articles/43000435317-stop-orders) for more information about this order type.


Closing Stop Market Order Example

```js
{
"time-in-force": "GTC",
"order-type": "Stop",
"stop-trigger": 105,
"legs": [
{
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"symbol": "AAPL",
"quantity": 100,
"action": "Sell to Close"
}
]
}

```


**Stop Limit**


Stop limit orders are limit orders that are triggered when the quote hits a specific price, called a **stop-trigger**. When the quote hits the stop-trigger, the order becomes a limit order.


Here are the rules for the JSON structure of a Stop Limit order:


- Must include a **price** and **price-effect**

- Must include a **stop-trigger** price


Please refer to our [help center article on stop orders](https://support.tastyworks.com/support/solutions/articles/43000435317-stop-orders) for more information about this order type.


Stop Limit Order Example

```js
{
"time-in-force": "GTC",
"order-type": "Stop",
"stop-trigger": 110,
"price": 115,
"price-effect": "Debit"
"legs": [
{
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"symbol": "AAPL",
"quantity": 100,
"action": "Buy to Open"
}
]
}

```


**Notional Market**


Notional Market means you are buying a dollar amount of an instrument. For example, instead of buying 1 share of AAPL, you could buy $10 of AAPL.


**NOTE - Notional orders can only be used to trade fractional shares. Please submit an order below ask price, or route a non-notional order for full shares.**


Here are the rules for the JSON structure of a Notional Market order:


- **order-type** must be `Notional Market`

- Orders must only have 1 leg

- Order legs cannot have **quantity**

- Order must include **value** and **value-effect**

- Only cryptocurrency and eligible equity symbols are permitted


Opening Notional Market orders cannot be submitted while the market is closed.


Notional Market orders must only have a single leg and the leg **must not** include a quantity.


The order must include a **value**, which is the dollar amount you wish to buy/sell. Along with **value**, you must also include **value-effect**. Refer to the [value section below](/order-submission/#value) for more info.


Notional market orders are allowed for cryptocurrencies and eligible equities. To determine if an equity is eligible, refer to the `is-fractional-quantity-eligible` field of the equity instrument's JSON representation. If the value is false, your order will be rejected. See the [equities](/order-submission/#equities-leg-symbol) section below for info on fetching an equity instrument.


Below is an example order JSON of buying $10 of AAPL:


Notional Market Order Example

```js
{
"time-in-force": "Day",
"order-type": "Notional Market",
"value": 10,
"value-effect": "Debit",
"legs": [
{
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"symbol": "AAPL",
"action": "Buy to Open"
}
]
}

```


The amount of shares you receive depends on the underlying price. If AAPL stock were at $100 right now and you submitted the above order for $10 worth of stock, you'd receive approximately 0.1 shares.


### Price and Price Effect


Price only applies to **Limit** and **Stop Limit** orders. Submitting a **Market**, **Stop**, or **Notional Market** order with a **price** is invalid and the request will be rejected.


When you include a **price**, you must always include a **price-effect** as well. Think of price effect as the direction the money is flowing in relation to your account. **Debit** means you are paying money. **Credit** means you are receiving money. In the example below, we are *receiving* $175.25 (Credit) to short sell 100 shares of AAPL stock.


Price effect is correlated to `leg.action`. If you are buying stock, your `leg.action` will be `Buy to Open` or `Buy to Close`. When buying, the price effect must be a `Debit`. Your order will be rejected if you try to buy for a credit. Same applies for selling. You can't sell something for a `Debit`.


Debit Limit Order Example

```js
{
"time-in-force": "Day",
"order-type": "Limit",
"price": 175.25,
"price-effect": "Credit",
"legs": [
{
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"quantity": 100,
"symbol": "AAPL",
"action": "Sell to Open"
}
]
}

```


| Price Effect | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Credit | Price will be credited to the customer's account |
| Debit | Price will be debited from the customer's account |


### Time In Force


Time in force means "How long do I want this order to live before it expires?" Refer to the [Market Sessions by Instrument Type](/order-submission/#tif-market-sessions) section to see the hours for each session.


| Time In Force | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Day | Works during regular market hours only. Expires at market close (3:00pm CT for equities, 4:00pm CT for futures). |
| GTC | Works during regular market hours and remains active until filled or manually canceled. |
| GTD | Works during regular market hours until filled or specified date. Requires gtc-date parameter. |
| Ext | Works during extended hours session (equities only: 6:00am - 7:00pm CT). Expires at 7:00pm CT. |
| GTC Ext | Works during extended hours session and remains active until filled or canceled. |
| Ext Overnight | Works during 24-hour session (equities only: 7:00pm - 7:00pm CT). Expires at 7:00pm CT. |
| GTC Ext Overnight | Works during 24-hour session and remains active until filled or canceled. |


**Day**


Day orders (like the one above) will live until either the order fills or the market closes. If a day order does not get filled by the time the market closes, it transitions to `expired`.


**GTC**


Good 'til Canceled orders never expire. They will work until they are either filled or the customer cancels them.


**GTD**


Good 'til Date orders expire on a given date. If you submit a GTD order, you must also include a `gtc-date` in the JSON (Yes, calling it `gtd-date` would have made more sense - we apologize).


Please refer to our [help center article about time in force](https://support.tastyworks.com/support/solutions/articles/43000435248-time-in-force-tif-day-gtc-gtd) for more information.


**Ext**


Extended hours orders expire at the end of the extended session. You may only submit single leg equity orders with this time in force.


**GTC Ext**


GTC Extended hours orders do not expire. They are active only during the extended session. You may only submit single leg equity orders with this time in force.


**Ext Overnight**


These orders are active during the 24-hour session (7pm-7pm CT). Expiration occurs every day at 7pm CT. If you submit an Ext Overnight order at noon, it will expire at 7pm the same day. If you submit an Ext Overnight order at 8:00pm CT, it will expire tomorrow at 7:00pm CT.


Markets are closed the night before a full holiday. For example, July 4th is a full day holiday. Markets will be closed starting July 3rd at 7:00pm CT. They will open up again July 4th at 7:00pm CT.


You may only submit single leg equity orders with this time in force.


**GTC Ext Overnight**


These orders are always active as long as the 24-hour session is open. They work until they are filled or until the user cancels the order.


You may only submit single leg equity orders with this time in force.


### Market Sessions by Instrument Type


#### Equities and Equity Options


- **Regular**: 8:30am-3:00pm CT

- **Extended**: 6:00am-7:00pm CT

- ** 24-Hour**: 7:00pm-7:00pm CT. Session starts the night before a regular session. First session of the week starts 7:00pm CT Sunday night. Overnight market is closed the night before market holiday.


#### Futures


- **Regular**: 5:00pm-4:00pm CT


#### Cryptocurrencies


- **Regular**: 24/7 (continuous trading)


### Value and Value Effect


This field only applies to **Notional Market** orders. It denotes the dollar amount you wish to buy/sell.


**value** must be accompanied by **value-effect**, which is identical to **price-effect** but only applies to Notional Market orders.


Including a **price** and a **value** is invalid and the request will be rejected.


| Value Effect | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Credit | Value will be credited to the customer's account |
| Debit | Value will be debited from the customer's account |


## Leg Attributes


Leg attributes are specific to their order leg. Each order leg represents an actual instrument (like a stock or an option) with a quantity and a side (action).


All orders must have a minimum of 1 leg.


The maximum number of legs an order can have depends on the instrument type:


- Equity, Futures, and Cryptocurrency orders are limited to 1 leg.

- Equity Option and Future Option orders can have up to 4 legs.


Refer to the table below for the JSON attributes of a leg object. Each attribute is explained in further detail in the sections below.


| Leg Attribute | Required | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| action | Yes | String | The side you are taking in relation to your positions |
| instrument-type | Yes | String | The class of the instrument being traded |
| quantity | Yes unless order-type is Notional Market | Decimal | The amount being bought or sold |
| symbol | Yes | String | The symbol representing the instrument being traded |


### Action


This is the "side" you are taking (buy or sell) combined with an "opening" or "closing" designation.


| Action | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Buy to Open | Open a long position by buying the instrument. You must not have an existing short position in that instrument. |
| Sell to Open | Open a short position by selling the instrument. You must not have an existing long position in that instrument. |
| Buy to Close | Close a short position by buying the instrument. You must have an existing short position in that instrument. |
| Sell to Close | Close a long position by selling the instrument. You must have an existing long position in that instrument. |
| Buy | Only applies to single leg outright futures trades. This action allows you to buy an outright future regardless of your position. If you are short an outright, this will result in closing your position. |
| Sell | Only applies to single leg outright futures trades. This action allows you to sell an outright future regardless of your position. If you are long an outright, this will result in closing your position. |


If you don't own any shares of AAPL and want to buy 100 shares, the action would be `Buy to Open` with a quantity of 100.


If you don't own any shares of AAPL and want to sell short 100 shares, the action would be `Sell to Open` with a quantity of 100.


If you own 100 shares of AAPL and want to close 10 shares, the action would be `Sell to Close` with a quantity of 10.


If you own 100 shares of AAPL and want to buy 100 *more* shares, the action would be `Buy to Open` with a quantity of 100.


`Buy to Open` and `Sell to Open` are opening actions, meaning they result in a new position being added to your account.


`Buy to Close` and `Sell to Close` are closing actions, meaning they result in an existing position's quantity decreasing.


You may send `Buy` or `Sell` for single leg outright futures trades if you wish. tastytrade's system will convert it to the appropriate action for you. Sending a `Sell` order when you are long an outright future contract will close your position. Sending a `Sell` order when you have no position will result in a new short position. Same logic applies for the `Buy` action with outright futures orders. You may still send the full action when trading futures if you wish to specify opening vs closing. See [Advanced Instructions](/order-submission/#advanced-instructions) below for more info.


#### Advanced Instructions


You should only submit closing orders against existing positions. For convenience, tastytrade will correct the Open/Close for you when you submit a closing order but don't have a corresponding position. For example, if you submit a `Buy to Close` order for AAPL but you don't have an AAPL position to close, tastytrade will route the order as `Buy to Open`. Likewise submitting a `Sell to Close` order when you don't have a position to close will result in a `Sell to Open` order being routed.


If you wish to block this behavior, you should submit your order with `advanced-instructions` specifying that you want `strict-position-effect-validation: true`. For example:


Advanced Instructions Example

```js
{
"time-in-force": "Day",
"order-type": "Limit",
"price": 175.25,
"price-effect": "Credit",
"advanced-instructions": {
"strict-position-effect-validation": true
},
"legs": [
{
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"quantity": 100,
"symbol": "META",
"action": "Sell to Close"
}
]
}

```


With `strict-position-effect-validation`, the order will be rejected if you don't have an existing position to close.


### Instrument Type


Valid instrument types are:


- Cryptocurrency

- Equity

- Equity Option

- Future

- Future Option


### Quantity


This denotes how much you want to buy or sell. For cryptocurrency orders, the quantity can have a decimal value. For equities, equity options, futures, and future options, the quantity must be a whole number (integer).


Here are the rules for including **quantity** in the order leg JSON:


- Must be a positive number

- Can have a decimal value for cryptocurrencies, otherwise must be a whole number (integer)

- Must **not** be included if **order-type** is `Notional Market`


If **order-type** is `Notional Market`, quantity must **not** be included in the JSON. A notional market order means you are buying a dollar amount of something, like "I want $10 of AAPL stock" or "I want $10 of BTC/USD". Instead, you must include a [value](/order-submission/#value) in the order JSON, which is the dollar amount you wish to buy/sell.


### Symbol


The symbol is the primary identifier of an instrument. Each leg must have its own distinct symbol with no overlap. An order with multiple legs with the same symbol is invalid and the request will be rejected.


If you are trading stocks, you'd just use the ticker symbol (AAPL for Apple, TSLA for Tesla, etc). Symbols for other instruments types like equity options and futures are a little less intuitive and will require you to look up the actual instrument symbols via our API.


Refer to the sections below to learn how to look up a symbol for each type of instrument.


**Equity Options**


If you want to trade options for a particular stock, the easiest thing to do is fetch the full option chain via the `GET /option-chains/{stock_symbol}/nested` endpoint found [here](https://developer.tastytrade.com/open-api-spec/instruments/#/option-chains/getOptionChainsSymbolNested). This endpoint returns all of the expirations that tastytrade offers for that given equity symbol. Nested inside each expiration is a list of strikes where each strike has a `call` and a `put` field, which are the call symbol and the put symbol, respectively. For an example, view the Instruments section of our [Api Guide](https://developer.tastytrade.com/api-guides/#instruments).


The `nested` endpoint is nice because it groups the options into their expirations and each expiration lists out the strike price with its associated call and put symbols in a very concise JSON format.


There are a couple other endpoints for fetching option chains: `GET /option-chains/{stock_symbol}/compact` lists out all option symbols for a given stock symbol without any expiration grouping. This endpoint might be useful if you already have a good idea of what you're looking to trade and just want a list of every option symbol for an underlying stock.


The last option chain endpoint is `GET /option-chains/{stock_symbol}`, which returns a list of equity option instruments for a given symbol. Each equity option is a full data representation, meaning it includes all data fields pertinent to that instrument, such as `exercise-style`, `expiration-date`, and `expiration-type`. As a result, this endpoint returns a **lot** of data. You would probably be better served by fetching data from the `/option-chains/{stock_symbol}/nested` endpoint, locating the symbols you're interested in trading, and then fetching only those instruments directly from the [GET /instruments/equity-options](https://developer.tastytrade.com/open-api-spec/instruments/#/instruments/getInstrumentsEquityOptions) endpoint.


Of course, fetching the instruments isn't required for submitting an order. You only need an instruments's **symbol** to trade. However, the equity option instrument JSON does provide additional data that many will find useful.


Equity Option orders can contain up to 4 legs.


**Equities**


Most of the time you won't need to look up any information for a particular stock. If you know the ticker symbol that you want to trade, you can just plug that into the **symbol** field of the leg JSON and submit your order.


If you want to view a full JSON representation of an equity instrument, you can either search multiple instruments by symbol or fetch a single isntrument by symbol:


To search for equities by symbol, send a `GET /instruments/equities?symbol[]=AAPL&symbol[]=TSLA`. View the docs for this endpoint [here](https://developer.tastytrade.com/open-api-spec/instruments/#/instruments/getInstrumentsEquities).


To fetch a single equity instrument by its symbol, you can hit the `GET /instruments/equities/{symbol}` endpoint directly.


The equity instrument JSON includes fields like `is-index`, `listed-market`, `active`, `is-fractional-quantity-eligible`, and `is-closing-only`.


Equity orders can contain only 1 leg.


**Futures**


To view all of the active futures contracts we offer, hit the `GET /instruments/futures` endpoint. Each item in the list returned is a full JSON representation of a future instrument. The JSON includes fields like `symbol`, `expiration-date`, `expires-at`, and `last-trade-date`. You can view the full JSON representation [here](https://developer.tastytrade.com/open-api-spec/instruments/#/instruments/getInstrumentsFutures).


If you are only interested in trading one or two specific futures products, you can filter the results by one or more `product-code` like this: `GET /instruments/futures?product-code[]=CL&product-code[]=ES`.


To get a list of all of the future product codes tastytrade supports, hit `GET /instruments/future-products`. This endpoint returns a JSON representation of a future **product**, not its instruments. You can't trade Crude Oil futures (/CL) the same way you trade stock. You must trade a specific futures *contract*, such as `/CLU3`, which is the September 2023 Crude Oil contract.


Futures orders can contain only 1 leg.


**Future Options**


The process of finding future options symbols is almost identical to the equity options process, but instead of hitting `GET /option-chains/{stock_symbol}/nested`, you hit `GET /futures-option-chains/{product_code}/nested`. The JSON returned is formatted a little differently than the equity options chains, but the overall idea is the same. Instruments are grouped into expirations, each of which contains a list of strikes with `call` and `put` fields, representing the call symbol and the put symbol, respectively.


There is also a `GET /futures-option-chains/{product_code}` endpoint which returns a list of all future option instruments for a given product code. This endpoint returns a **lot** of data. You would probably be better served by fetching data from the `/futures-option-chains/{product_code}/nested` endpoint and locating the symbols you're interested in trading. If you need more info on the symbols and their respective instruments, you should then fetch those instruments directly from the `GET /instruments/futures-options?symbol[]=symbol1&symol[]=symbol2` endpoint documented [here](https://developer.tastytrade.com/open-api-spec/instruments/#/instruments/getInstrumentsFutureOptions).


If you only want to trade a specific future option product, like monthly E-mini S&P 500 options (ES), you can filter your search by that option product code: `GET /instruments/future-options?option-root-symbol=ES`.


To get a list of all the future option product codes that tastytrade supports, hit `GET /instruments/future-option-products`. This endpoint returns a JSON representation of a future option **product**, not its instruments.


A future option product's JSON contains fields like `root-symbol`, `code`, `exchange`, and `expiration-type`. You should treat **root-symbol** as the primary identifier for a product, **not** code.


Future option orders can contain up to 4 legs.


**Cryptocurrencies**


You can retrieve a list of cryptocurrencies that tastytrade supports via the `GET /instruments/cryptocurrencies` endpoint documented [here](https://developer.tastytrade.com/open-api-spec/instruments/#/instruments/getInstrumentsCryptocurrencies). Each instrument returned contains a **symbol** field that you should include in the leg JSON.


Cryptocurrency orders can only contain 1 leg.


## Order Responses


### Order Rejected


Our system runs a number of validations on any order it receives. Any validation errors will result in your order being rejected with a `422` status code and a json payload detailing the reason. For example:


```js
"error": {
"code": "preflight_check_failure",
"message": "One or more preflight checks failed",
"errors": [
{
"code": "cant_buy_for_credit",
"message": "You cannot buy for a credit."
}
]
}

```


The above response indicates that you tried to submit a buy order with a `"price-effect": "Credit"`, which is not allowed.


### Order Accepted


Assuming your order passes all the validations our order system performs, you will receive a response with an order id and a status of `Routed`, among other data. We'll provide a description of the response keys below:


**buying-power-effect** - A json object containing data that details the impact this order will have on your account's buying power.


**closing-fee-calculation** - An estimation of the fees you may see in the future when you close the position created by this order. This is provided as a convenience and is purely an estimation. The fees are not applied to this order.


**fee-calculation** - An estimation of the fees you may see as a result of this order being filled. Fees are broken into separate categories and totaled at the end.


**order** - A json object containing status and tracking details about your order. For an overview of order status flow, head to our [Order Flow section](/order-flow). For an overview of tracking and managing your orders, head to our [Order Management section](/order-management).


**order.legs.fills** - An array of order leg fill details. An order leg can have zero or many fills. For example, if you have a buy order for 100 shares, you could potentially receive 100 fills (1 per share). You could also receive a single fill for 100 shares. Each fill will have a quantity and will affect your positions. For example, a buy order of 100 shares will result in a position with quantity 100 when the order fills. Head to our [overview section on orders and positions](/api-overview/#high-level-concepts) for more details.


**warnings** - We return warnings when you do an order dry run via `POST /accounts/{account_number}/orders/dry-run`. These are informational warnings. Some may give you a heads up that your order will be rejected if you were to try to route it. Other warnings may indicate that the market is closed and your order will be routed when the market opens up again.

### Complex Orders


These orders are submitted to the `POST /accounts/{account_number}/complex-orders` endpoint.


Please refer to the help center article [here](https://support.tastyworks.com/support/solutions/articles/43000544221-bracket-orders) for more information about these types of trades.


Please note that `BLAST` orders are deprecated and are not currently supported in any of our environments. Supported complex order types are: `OTOCO`, `OCO`, `OTO`, and `PAIRS`.


The following are some example JSON payloads for complex orders. Note that OTOCO orders have a `trigger-order` property as well as an `orders` property. The trigger order will go live immediately while the other orders will be in `Contingent` status until the trigger order fills. Once the trigger order fills, the other orders will be sent.


AAPL OTOCO Order

```json
{
"type": "OTOCO",
"trigger-order": {
"order-type": "Limit",
"price": 157.97,
"price-effect": "Debit",
"time-in-force": "Day",
"legs": [{
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"symbol": "AAPL",
"action": "Buy to Open",
"quantity": 100
}]
},
"orders": [
{
"order-type": "Limit",
"price": 198.68,
"price-effect": "Credit",
"time-in-force": "GTC",
"legs": [{
"symbol": "AAPL",
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"action": "Sell to Close",
"quantity": 100
}]
},
{
"order-type": "Stop",
"time-in-force": "GTC",
"stop-trigger": 143.06,
"legs": [{
"symbol": "AAPL",
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"action": "Sell to Close",
"quantity": 100
}]
}
]
}

```


OCO orders do not have a `trigger-order` property. The `orders` go live immediately.


AAPL OCO Order

```json
{
"type": "OCO",
"orders": [
{
"order-type": "Limit",
"price": 198.68,
"price-effect": "Credit",
"time-in-force": "GTC",
"legs": [{
"symbol": "AAPL",
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"action": "Sell to Close",
"quantity": 100
}]
},
{
"order-type": "Stop",
"time-in-force": "GTC",
"stop-trigger": 143.06,
"legs": [{
"symbol": "AAPL",
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"action": "Sell to Close",
"quantity": 100
}]
}
]
}

```


### Fractional Stock Orders


tastytrade only supports fractional trading of certain equity products. To determine if an equity can be fractionally traded, fetch the equity instrument and check the `is-fractional-quantity-eligible` field. For example: `GET /instruments/equities?symbol[]=AAPL` returns `"is-fractional-quantity-eligible": true`.


Fractional orders must have a minimum monetary value of $5. Buy orders for 0.5 shares of a $1 stock will be rejected.


Fractional Quantity Order

```json
{
"time-in-force": "Day",
"order-type": "Market",
"legs": [
{
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"symbol": "AAPL",
"quantity": 0.5,
"action": "Buy to Open"
}
]
}

```


To buy $10 of AAPL stock, submit a `Notional Market` order with a `value` instead of a `price`. Omit the `quantity` field from the legs:


Notional Amount Order

```json
{
"time-in-force": "Day",
"order-type": "Notional Market",
"value": 10.0,
"value-effect": "Debit",
"legs": [
{
"instrument-type": "Equity",
"symbol": "AAPL",
"action": "Buy to Open"
}
]
}

```
